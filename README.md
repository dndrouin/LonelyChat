# LonelyChat
Have you ever thought to yourself, "Man, I really wish I could talk to someone right now, but actually, not really"? Boy, do I have the solution for you! Enter LonelyChat, the chat client for people that just want to talk to themselves. It's all the fun of talking to someone else but with none of the pesky "talking to someone else" part.




On a serious note, this is just a way for me to mess around with javax.swing. I've never done anything with a GUI before and it's honestly pretty fun.

Please note that it's not finished by any means.
